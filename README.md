# NBA Betting Stat Projector: End-to-End Development

## Project Overview
- Developed a comprehensive **end-to-end betting statistics projection system** combining web scraping, data transformation, and advanced analytics
- Successfully implemented and monetized the system, with documented profits showcased on [Tufflaystay Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/tufflaystay/)

## Technical Approach

### Data Acquisition
- Implemented web scraping pipelines to collect **NBA team and player statistics** from official sources
- Designed automated data collection processes to ensure up-to-date information

### Statistical Modeling
- Developed a **two-layer Z-score analysis system**:
  1. Team-level defensive scores by position (first Z-score layer)
  2. Player performance scores relative to team defensive averages (second Z-score layer)
- Created proprietary metrics to quantify matchup advantages

### Implementation & Results
- Built a fully functional backend system capable of processing live data
- Maintained strategic documentation to protect intellectual property while demonstrating technical capabilities
- Achieved measurable success in real-world betting applications

## Code Samples
